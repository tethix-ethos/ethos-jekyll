# About ETHOS

## Your responsible tech journey companion.

Nurturing your ETHOS is a lifetime journey.

As with any journey in life, you can increase your chances of success by finding some companions and gathering the right equipment. We invite you to use ETHOS to fill your exploration backpack with seeds, sparks, tools, and other good intentions that can help you nurture your ETHOS. And remember: ETHOS is best used with friends and colleagues. 

## ðŸŒ‘ Today: a seedling for your ETHOS

Currently, ETHOS is in seedling stage and allows you to explore various ETHOS intents. It is also an invitation to start nurturing your daily ETHOS practice through reflection prompts, either by slowing down underneath the ETHOS tree or exploring your reflection in different types of future mirrors.

## ðŸŒ“ Tomorrow: helping you develop Elemental Ethics skills

Over time, we hope to bring back the option to create ETHOS profiles and collect ETHOS intents in your backpack and toolbox. 

With that, the actions you take on the ETHOS platform will start transforming your ETHOS experience in subtle ways, encouraging you to develop all <a href="https://tethix.co/elemental-ethics/" class="external">Elemental Ethics</a> skills: collaboration, research, practice, and reflection.

## ðŸŒ• Vision: bridging your intent to action gap

Once the seedling fully matures, you will be able to connect ETHOS to tools you use every day, such as Slack or Jira, and keep track of how your intents turn into actions. You'll be able to plant seeds of good intentions in team ETHOS gardens and nurture them with your team(s) as you try to build more responsible tech together.

<a href="https://tethix.co/product-ethos/" class="external">Our vision</a> is to grow ETHOS into a tool which helps you bridge the intent to action gap through a playful, immersive experience that trains your moral imagination.

But we'll need your help to get there...

## ðŸ’œ We need you help

We are currently looking for feedback and supporters to help us improve your ETHOS experience. If you'd like to get involved or just chat about ETHOS, send us a message at ethos@tethix.co
