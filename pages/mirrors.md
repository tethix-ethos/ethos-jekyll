# What are Tethix Mirrors?

The Taxonomy of Tethix Mirrors draws upon varying shades of optimism, realism, and critique, categorising perspectives into four distinct “mirrors”: Black, Bright, Grey, and Rainbow. Each mirror offers a unique vantage point to explore the possible, projected, probable and preferable futures we’re collectively creating, from dystopian warnings to utopian dreams, from pragmatic outlooks to inclusive aspirations.

By categorising the multifaceted views of technology into distinct ‘mirrors,’ it aids in discerning and aligning technological development with ethical considerations, societal needs, and long-term impacts on human flourishing and environmental regeneration. It’s a strategic design instrument for thought leaders, red teams, blue teams, purple teams, product designers, and policymakers to navigate the intricate moral landscape that technology presents, ensuring that tech innovation is not just functionally adept but also ethically sound and socially responsible. The taxonomy serves as a guiding tool to sense make and can support in:

- **Evaluating Impact**: Assessing the potential societal, ethical, and environmental impacts of a technology.
- **Guiding Development**: Informing the design and development phases to align with desired ethical and social outcomes.
- **Facilitating Discussion**: Stimulating debate and reflection on the potential long-term consequences and the moral responsibilities of tech creators and decision makers.
- **Educating Stakeholders**: Helping all participants understand the different perspectives and values that come into play with technological advancements.
- **Inspiring Policies**: Aiding in the creation of governance and policy that considers a range of outcomes and moral considerations.
