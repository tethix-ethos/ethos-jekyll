The Collective Imagination Practices Toolkit aims to collate and platform the wisdom of Collective Imagination practitioners around the world, creating an accessible set of tools for anyone who wants to build the capacity to explore and learn a spectrum of practices related to Collective Imagination (as well as unlearn those practices that might block their inquiry). 

Across six thematic sections, this toolkit shares frameworks, infrastructures and guided visioning, reflection, mediation and reorientation practices for individuals, groups and organisations to experiment with seeing, feeling and thinking differently, in order to act differently. The content has been developed by a wide range of brilliant thinkers, practitioners, and artists who have practised in this space for many years.
