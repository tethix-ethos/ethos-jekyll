The Human-AI eXperience (HAX) Toolkit was designed for teams building user-facing AI products. It helps you conceptualize what the AI system will do and how it will behave. It's best used early in your design process. 

The toolkit includes:

- [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/): Best practices for how AI systems should behave during interaction. Use them to guide your AI product planning.
- [HAX Design Library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/library/): Learn the Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction and how to apply them, using patterns and examples.
- [HAX Workbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/workbook/): Work together with your team to prioritize which Guidelines to implement in your product.
- [HAX Playbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/playbook/): For applications using natural language processing, identify common failures so you can plan for mitigating them.
