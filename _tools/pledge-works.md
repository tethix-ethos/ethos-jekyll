A practical tool that invites you to write pledges for better outcomes as part of your existing product development processes. This modular and adaptable tool supports responsible design and development in different contexts. It was developed to bridge the gap between good intentions and everyday product decisions. Its core idea is to **write pledges for better outcomes** at every step of your existing processes, in cascading levels of granularity.
