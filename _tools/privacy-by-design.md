Privacy by design is an approach to systems engineering initially developed by Ann Cavoukian and formalized in a report on privacy-enhancing technologies by a joint team of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (Canada), the Dutch Data Protection Authority, and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research in 1995. It has been highly influential globally and has since evolved to be a foundational reference point for bringing privacy to the forefront of decision making.
