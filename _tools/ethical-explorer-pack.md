Ethical Explorer is a DIY kit designed to spark group discussion, identify early warning signs, build internal support, and brainstorm solutions to avoid future risks. The kit includes:

- **Field Guide**: This overview of the Ethical Explorer Pack suggests activities and workshops for both individuals and groups, and ideas for starting the conversation and gaining buy-in within organizations.
- **Tech Risk Zones**: Eight Tech Risk Zone cards — plus one blank card to tailor to a specific need or scenario — can help provoke thoughtful conversations around risk, responsibility, and impact in key areas, such as surveillance.
