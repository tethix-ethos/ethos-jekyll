Partnership on AI’s (PAI) Responsible Practices for Synthetic Media is a framework on how to responsibly develop, create, and share synthetic media: the audiovisual content often generated or modified by AI.

PAI offers recommendations for different categories of stakeholders with regard to their roles in developing, creating, and distributing synthetic media. These categories are not mutually exclusive. A given stakeholder could fit within several categories, as in the case of social media platforms. These categories include:

1. Those building technology and infrastructure for synthetic media
2. Those creating synthetic media
3. Those distributing and publishing synthetic media
