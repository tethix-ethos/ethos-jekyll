The “Taxonomy of Tethix Mirrors” draws upon varying shades of optimism, realism, and critique, categorising perspectives into four distinct “mirrors”: Black, Bright, Grey, and Rainbow. Each mirror offers a unique vantage point to explore the possible, projected, probable and preferable futures we’re collectively creating, from dystopian warnings to utopian dreams, from pragmatic outlooks to inclusive aspirations.

It's a tool to start conversations, educate stakeholders and explore the impacts of technology on society and life on this planet.
