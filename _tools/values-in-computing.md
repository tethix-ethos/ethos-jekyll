The Values in Computing (ViC) Framework is designed to explore and integrate human values into software development and computing systems. It recognizes that all digital artifacts, from software products to system architectures, are shaped by the values of the individuals and organizations involved in their creation. By drawing from psychological and social sciences, the ViC Framework provides tools for systematically identifying and analyzing values such as fairness, transparency, and public good within the software production process.
