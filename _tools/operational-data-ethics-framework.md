A consistent set of operational processes to decide, document and verify that the data processing activities undertaken by our company are socially preferable in intent and outcome. Empirically supporting the 'best' choice in a highly collaborative, coordinated and participatory manner.

This tool is a visual representation of an Operational Data Ethics Framework. It can be likened to a systems diagram, demonstrating inputs, throughputs and outputs. It accounts for proactive, retroactive and retrospective decision making contexts. It can be used by teams as a frame of reference for how to design a whole-of-organisation, skills based and behaviour driven approach to operationalizing data ethics.

As an example of how organisations have used this, see [this case study from Autodesk](https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Beyond-feel-good-statements_-Its-time-to-operationalise-data-ethics.pdf).
