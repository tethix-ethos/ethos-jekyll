Data ethics refer and adhere to the principles and values ​​on which human rights and personal data protection laws are based. It’s about honest and genuine transparency in data management. To actively develop privacy-by-design and privacy-enhancing products and infrastructures. To treat someone else’s personal information as you wish your own, or your children’s, treated.

Data ethics is the step further than mere compliance with personal data protection laws: All data processing therefore respects as a minimum the requirements set out in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights.
