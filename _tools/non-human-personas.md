Non-human and non-user personas represent the animals, environments, and ‘invisible’ humans (factory workers, miners, farmers, communities, etc.) impacted by product lifecycles so that we may design to protect and respect them.

Non-human personas may include:

- Threats to the stakeholder’s current condition
- Where and when the stakeholder is impacted by the product life-cycle
- Use of first-person narrative and verbatim to personify the non-human persona to assist empathy among the team
