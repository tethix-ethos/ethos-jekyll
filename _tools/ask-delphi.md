Delphi is a research prototype designed to investigate the promises and more importantly, the limitations of modeling peopleâ€™s moral judgments on a variety of everyday situations. The goal of Delphi is to help AI systems be more ethically-informed and equity-aware. By taking a step in this direction, we hope to inspire our research community to tackle the research challenges in this space head-on to build ethical, reliable, and inclusive AI systems.
