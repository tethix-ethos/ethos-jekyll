Algorithms are fallible human creations, so they are embedded with errors and bias like human processes. When algorithmic tools are adopted by government agencies without adequate transparency, accountability, and oversight, their use can threaten civil liberties and exacerbate existing issues within government agencies (e.g. bias, inefficiencies, opacity regarding decision making). We know that federal, state and local governments are increasingly implementing algorithmic systems in their daily practices, but we still do not know how widespread and integrated such algorithmic systems are used at any level of government.

The following toolkit is intended to provide legal and policy advocates with a basic understanding of government use of algorithms including, a breakdown of key concepts and questions that may come up when engaging with this issue, an overview of existing research, and summaries of algorithmic systems currently used in government. This toolkit also includes resources for advocates interested in or currently engaged in work to uncover where algorithms are being used and to create transparency and accountability mechanisms.
