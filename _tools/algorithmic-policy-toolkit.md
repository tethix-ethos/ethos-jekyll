AI Now developed a toolkit to help advocates uncover and understand where algorithms are being used in government and to inform advocacy strategies and tactics. The toolkit includes a breakdown of key concepts and questions, an overview of existing research, summaries of algorithmic systems currently used in government, and guidances on advocacy strategies to identify and interrogate the use of these systems.
