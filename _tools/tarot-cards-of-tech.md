From feeds full of fake news to smartphone addiction, we are all waking up to the unintended consequences of technology. The team at Artefact Group think it's time to ditch the Silicon Valley mantra, "Move fast and break things" for a new approach: Slow down and ask the right questions.

The Tarot Cards of Tech are a set of provocations designed to help creators more fully consider the impact of technology. They not only help you foresee unintended consequences, they can also reveal opportunities for creating positive change.
