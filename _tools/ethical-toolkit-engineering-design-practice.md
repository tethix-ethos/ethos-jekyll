A set of seven tools that represent concrete ways of implementing ethical reflection, deliberation, and judgment into tech industry engineering and design workflows. Each tool performs a different ethical function, and can be further customized for specific applications. Team/project leaders should reflect carefully on how each tool can best be used in their team or project settings. 

The toolkit includes seven tools:

- Tool 1: Ethical Risk Sweeping
- Tool 2: Ethical Pre-mortems and Post-mortems
- Tool 3: Expanding the Ethical Circle
- Tool 4: Case-based Analysis
- Tool 5: Remembering the Ethical Benefits of Creative Work
- Tool 6: Think About the Terrible People
