Based on nearly two decades of work in Value Sensitive Design, the Envisioning Cards are designed to evoke consideration and discussion of such concerns within the context of design practice.

Designers often focus on the immediate context of use: how will a product be used by the person who purchases it? Designers rarely have the time to consider the long-term and indirect effects of their technologies. How will use of the product affect the user’s family and neighbours? If use of the product becomes common, how will it affect the larger community? How will people in a different culture adapt the product to their needs? What happens to the product after it’s thrown away?

We feel it is important to envision the long-term influence of new technology – as it spans across time, becomes pervasive throughout society, affects the lives of different stakeholders, and raises issues that touch human values. Based on nearly two decades of work in Value Sensitive Design, the Envisioning Cards are designed to evoke consideration and discussion of such concerns within the context of design practice.
