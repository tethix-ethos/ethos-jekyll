A framework grounded in psychological research that can allow HCI researchers and practitioners to form actionable insights with respect to how technology designs support or undermine basic psychological needs, thereby increasing motivation and engagement, and ultimately, improving user wellbeing. We propose that in order to address wellbeing, psychological needs must be considered within five different spheres of analysis including: at the point of technology *adoption*, during interaction with the *interface*, as a result of engagement with technology-specific *tasks*, as part of the technology-supported *behavior*, and as part of an individual's *life* overall.
