The Better Disclosure Toolkit brings together Human Centred Design, the Behavioural Sciences and traditional legal practice to radically improve the way that contracts and disclosures are designed.

The Better Disclosure Canvas is the central artefact within the toolkit. It guides teams through a series of 8, evidence based considerations, to support their Better Disclosure design journey. The canvas is currently available as a template in Mural.

The canvas has been used in a variety of contexts and helped produce high profile, first of their kind disclosures. Regional Australia Bank's Consumer Data Right policy is a good example of this. [Here's their Chief Digital Officer talking candidly about the process](https://vimeo.com/485365972/754e474cc0).

You can find a comprehensive evidence kit to support the canvas and your Better Disclosure practices here: [Better Disclosure Evidence Kit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Da563HnpLGQ9QY05Pb9hWMCKSEI2Yd98/view?usp=sharing).
