The Better Disclosure Toolkit bring together Human Centred Design, the Behavioural Sciences and traditional legal practice to radically improve the way that contracts and disclosures are designed.

The Better Disclosure Canvas is the central artefact within the toolkit. It guides teams through a series of 8, evidence based considerations, to support their Better Disclosure design journey. The canvas can be printed for folks working together in the same location. For those working remotely, the canvas is available as a template in Mural.

The canvas has been used in a variety of contexts and helped produce high profile, first of their kind disclosures. Regional Australia Bank's Consumer Data Right policy is a good example of this. [Here's their Chief Digital Officer talking candidly about the process](https://vimeo.com/485365972/754e474cc0).
