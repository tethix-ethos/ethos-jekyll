A card deck inspired by The Good Place, Oblique strategies, by Brian Eno, and a potent cocktail of feelings about the State of TechTM. The Ethics Litmus test was created to be accessible, beautiful, easy- to- use- tool which helps us move from an uncomfortable feeing to action.

The accompanying activities are launched from the assumption that our character is voluntary, and we can improve it by practicing to be good. Ethical behaviour and decision-making are the outcome of practice as opposed to an innate characteristic.  Itâ€™s a capability we can encourage and nurture in ourselves and in our teams, like any other.

Much like learning to code, it might feel uncomfortable or foreign at first, but may also become second-nature more quickly than we might think.
