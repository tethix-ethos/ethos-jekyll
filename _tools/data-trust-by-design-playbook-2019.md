The Data Trust by Design playbook is part of a toolkit that helps teams and organisations to systematically design for trust in data enabled products and services. The 2019 playbook will introduce you to the 6 principles, a range of design pattern examples, practices to use and case studies. So many of our digital products and services are reliant on data and building trust in the data collection and use practices is paramount. The organisations that take this seriously will gain access to more data, helping them to drive more data enabled innovation and be on the path to win their market. This playbook can help you and your teams on this path.
