The Flourishing Business Toolkit introduces the new paradigm of “sustainability as flourishing” expressed as a normative goal and desirable outcome.

The Flourishing Business Canvas provides a common language for describing and designing enterprises with a diverse range of stakeholders and goals. It builds an understanding of the interconnections of the organization, its products and services with its communities and the world by supporting users to consider the multi-value measures of environmental, social, and economical, and the multi-stakeholder perspectives, along with associated value co-creation and value co-destruction within a systems perspective. The canvas allows businesses to start with their core values, while designing, testing, and iterating on their model(s).
