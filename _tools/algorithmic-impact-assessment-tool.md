The AIA is a questionnaire designed to help you assess and mitigate the risks associated with deploying an automated decision system. The AIA also helps identify the impact level of your automated decision system under the Directive on Automated Decision-Making.Â  We are developing the AIA in the open, making regular updates thanks to feedback through public workshops and online testing. You can follow its development, or see how your own project measures up.
