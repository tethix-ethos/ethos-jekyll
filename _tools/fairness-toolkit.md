The Fairness Toolkit to promote awareness and stimulate a **public civic dialogue** about how algorithms shape online experiences and to reflect on possible changes to address issues of online unfairness. The tools are not just for critical thinking, but for **civic thinking** â€“ supporting a more collective approach to imagining the future as a contrast to the individual atomising effect that such technologies often cause.
