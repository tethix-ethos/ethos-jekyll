A Foresight Game is used within the Government of Canada to train policymakers to think critically and imaginatively about the future implications of emerging change. IMPACT was originally developed in collaboration with Policy Horizons Canada. The game’s narrative content is based on Policy Horizons’ report, [MetaScan 3](http://www.horizons.gc.ca/sites/default/files/Publication-alt-format/pdf_version_0239_6698kb-45pages.pdf), which explores how disruptive technologies may shape the economy and society.

**IMPACT is best played with 3-6 players and lasts 60-90 minutes.**
