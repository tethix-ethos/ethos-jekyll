Community jury, an adaptation of the citizen jury, is a technique where diverse stakeholders impacted by a technology are provided an opportunity to learn about a project, deliberate together, and give feedback on use cases and product design. This technique allows project teams to understand the perceptions and concerns of impacted stakeholders.

A community jury is different from a focus group or market research; it allows the impacted stakeholders to hear directly from the subject matter experts in the product team, and cocreate solutions to challenging problems with them.
